# To know

This exercise was proposed in my Full Stack Developer bootcam at The Bridge. The instruccions are in the file `instructions.md` (in Spanish).

The main purpose of the exercise is to create an Express app using NodeJS with MongoDB (which was the module we were learning at the moment).

This exercise takes data from NASA landings and neas (located in `src/seeds` and imported to MongoDB using `--mongoimport`).

Then, with the data, is necessary to create different endpoint in order to GET information using either query params, req params or body.

Lastly, for the collection Users (made up from scratch for the exercise), is necessary to create different endpoints (GET, PUT, POST, DELETE) in order to interact with that collection and its data.
